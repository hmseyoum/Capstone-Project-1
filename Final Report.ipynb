    "I was surprised to see `bedrooms` have a negative coeficient, since my assumption was that when the number of bedrooms increase, so does the price. However, we saw previously with a `bedrooms` and `price` scatterplot that price increases with number of bedrooms only for homes with up to 5 bedrooms. The price then starts to decrease for homes with 6 bedrooms or more.  \n",
    "Notice also `bedrooms_squared` has a positive coeficient. This feature is `bedrooms` with a parabolic transformation. Since this feature has adjusted for `bedrooms` shape, it makes sense that it is positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is the coefficient of `sqft_lot` negative, but it's also a small number, indicating that its affect on  price is miniscule."

    "The following analysis is based on my 95% confidence that the error in the home price predictions is between -429250 and -429250:\n",
    "\n",
    "If I've predicted a house to be $\\$$500,000 and someone were to buy the house at that price, the worst loss would be \\\\$429250 and the highest gain would be \\\\$429250. That is, the least the house would be worth is \\\\$70,750 (500,000-429250), and the most the house would be worth is \\\\$929,250 (500,000+429250).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say my boss wants to buy a house at below my estimate in the hopes of flipping it, i.e., selling the house at around double the price at which he acquired it. With a house that I have estimated to be \\\\$500,000, if he purchases it at \\\\$300,000 for example, 3 things can happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. My estimation is correct and he would make a profit of \\\\$200,000 by selling it for \\\\$500,000.  \n",
    "2. The house is actually worth \\\\$70,750 and he ends up buying at a higher price than what the house is worth, losing \\\\$229,250 on the purchase, and resulting in a 24\\% loss.\n",
    "3. The house is actually worth \\\\$929,250 and he ends up buying \\\\$629,250 below the house value, resulting in a 309\\%  profit if he were to sell it at \\\\$929,250.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens if my boss purchases 100 homes at my predicted price?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If my boss was to buy 100 homes at my predicted price and sell them at their true price, I can be 95\\% confident that the most she would lose is \\\\$4,358,500 and the most she would gain is \\\\$4,979,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens if my boss purchases 100 homes \\\\$1000 below my predicted prices?**\n",

    "If my boss was to buy 100 homes at \\\\$1000 less than my predicted price and sell them at their true price, I can be 95% confident that the most she would lose is \\\\$4,309,300 and the most she would gain is \\\\$4,734,600.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if she purchases 100 homes at $1000 below my predicted price, the most she would lose decreases by \\\\$49,200.\n",

Also, there aren't many houses with over 6 bedrooms, so the decrease in average price for houses with over 6 bedrooms could be due to lack of sufficient data.\n",
